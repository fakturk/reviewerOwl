### 📖 Summary
The story starts with a 20-year-old man deciding to take a bicycle trip from his home to Vancouver, Canada. None of his friends want to go, so he goes alone. This was 1970, and he needed time to think. He's running from a lot: the Vietnam War (his draft number is 63), a recent breakup, and even an affair with his teacher's wife.

The first half of the book is his physical journey to Vancouver and the memories from his childhood that come up along the way. The second half is about his new life at San Francisco State College. Here, we see his relationships with new girlfriends and the struggles of living in the city. The story takes a dark turn when his girlfriend is killed by the husband of a friend—a man who was trying to find them. This tragedy forces him to face the dangers he tried to leave behind.

### 📊 Literary Scorecard
| **Category** | **Rating** | **Highlights** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Character Psychology** | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (4) | You get inside his head. His reasons for the trip—the war, his love life—feel real and messy. |
| **Pacing & Flow** | ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (3) | The bike trip part is very slow. It picks up when he gets to college, but the shift is jarring. |
| **World-Building & 70s Vibe** | ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (3) | You get a sense of the time, but it stays in the background. I wanted to feel the 70s vibe more. |
| **Supporting Cast & Relationships** | ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (3.5) | The girlfriends and friends are okay, but they don't feel fully developed. The husband is a simple villain. |
| **Stakes & Tension** | ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (3) | The personal stakes are clear, but the big tension doesn't kick in until very late in the book. |
| **Overall** | ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (3.5) | A decent character piece, but other areas don't fully support it. |

### ✅ What I Like
- The main character's voice feels authentic. His confusion about life, love, and the war is the best part of the book.
- The core idea of using a physical trip to show a mental journey is solid.
- When the tension finally arrives with the murder, it's a good, shocking moment.

### ❌ What I Don't Like
- The first part of the bike trip is a real slog. It takes too long to get to the more interesting college plot.
- The side characters, especially the girlfriends, feel a bit flat. I didn't feel a strong connection to them.
- The 1970s setting and the Vietnam War are important, but they don't feel as alive or immersive as they could.

### 🎯 You'll Love This If You Enjoy:
- **Character-driven stories** - This is all about getting inside the main character's head.
- **Slow-burn dramas** - If you don't mind a slow start to get to the drama.

### ⚠️ Be Aware If You Prefer:
- **Fast-paced action** - The beginning is very slow and thoughtful.
- **Strong side characters** - The focus is almost entirely on the main character.
- **High tension** - The stakes feel low for a large part of the book.
